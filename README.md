# inquirer-readme-generator

## Description

The challenge this week was to create a high-quality README document for an app or other web-project using a command-line application.
It should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

You can see a walkthrough of the completed product here: (https://www.loom.com/share/dc56090164444c7e8ca60ce0c802ae9a?sid=b9b4f8ee-651b-4ae0-959b-b2795f7dfa95)

## Installation

There are no unique installation requirements for this product.

## Usage

The command-line application has simple usage.
To start, open the terminal in your VS Code browser.
Type Node index.js
You will then be presented with a series of questions, the answers of which will form the content in the final ReadMe file.
Once the final question is answered the application will auto generate a ReadMe file called SampleReadMe.md.
